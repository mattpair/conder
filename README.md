Making distrubuted systems easier to define.

# Design Principles

Writing code in conduit should be easy. It should use language that is clear, but also capable of communicating complex ideas.

## Concept Selection

We must select the concepts for the language deliberately. The guiding principles for concept selection are:

- Infrastructure agnostic
- Familiar
- Functionally complete


## Writers' Assumptions

All language is ambiguous. Ambiguity is resolved with assumptions of intent. Writers of conduit code may assume

- Infinitely scalable
- As fast as possible
- Cost efficient
- Fault Tolerant
- No race conditions

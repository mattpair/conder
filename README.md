Democratizing cloud-scale development.

# Goal

Building cloud-scale systems today is labor intensive and error-prone. Conder intends to solve this by creating 
**a high-level programming language that just deploys, scales, and works**.

## Concept Selection

We must select the concepts for the language deliberately. The guiding principles for concept selection are:

- High-level: Users should only have to work on things that are unique to their business. The rest should be abstracted away.
- Familiar: The purpose of the language is not to make the language designers feel smart. It's for other people.


## Writers' Assumptions

All language is ambiguous. Ambiguity is resolved with assumptions of intent. Writers of conduit code may assume
their deployments are:

- Infinitely scalable
- As fast as possible
- Cost efficient
- Fault Tolerant
